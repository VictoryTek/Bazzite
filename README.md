# Bazzite Installer Script

<img src="https://github.com/VictoryTek/VictoryNobara/blob/main/VictoryNobara.png" />

This README contains the steps I do to install and configure a fully-functional Nobara Linux after installation containing all my preferred applications and utilities. The shell scripts in this repo allow the entire process to be automated.)

## Create Nobara ISO

Download Bazzite from https://bazzite.gg/ and put it on a USB drive with Etcher, Ventoy, Rufus or Popsicle.

```
git clone https://github.com/VictoryTek/Bazzite
cd Bazzite
chmod +x bazzite.sh

./bazzite.sh

```

A script developed for customizing Arch, then adapted for Fedora, now adapted for Nobara, now adapted for Bazzite.
